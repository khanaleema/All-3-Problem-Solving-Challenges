# 🧠 Assignment 3: Problem-Solving Challenges (Python)

Welcome to my mini Python project where I solved three classic problem-solving challenges. These exercises are part of my learning journey to improve logic building and hands-on coding skills.

## 📌 Description

This assignment includes 3 small Python problems that focus on string manipulation and numerical logic:

1. **Reverse a String**
2. **Count Vowels in a String**
3. **Sum of Digits of a Number**

Each problem is solved using beginner-friendly logic and real-world relatable approaches.


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repo or download the `.py` files.
3. Open terminal or command prompt.
4. Run any file using:
python app.py

## 🎯 What I Learned
